# react-markdown

We had to fork and use this version of the repo because the original seems to be lacking maintenance. [See original](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)

To modify code further:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. CD in and npm install
3. Make changes necessary
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Push up
6. Run `npm update react-markdown` in the repo that uses this library
